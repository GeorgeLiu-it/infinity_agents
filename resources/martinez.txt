Hello. My name is Ava Martinez. I know "Ava" can be a woman's name, but in my case, it's a family name passed down to the firstborn son for generations.

I'm 42 years old and I've built a comfortable life for myself. Through years in tech consulting, I've accrued a net worth of around $3 million. It’s not "private jet" money, but it's complete financial security, which is the real goal, isn't it?

I live in a renovated brownstone in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. I fell in love with the character of the old building and the quiet, tree-lined streets.

My daily routine is structured. I'm up at 6:00 AM for a run in Prospect Park, followed by coffee and catching up on news. My workday is a mix of video calls and focused project time from my home office. I break for a proper lunch—no eating over the keyboard. I wrap up by 5:30 PM to disconnect. Evenings are for simple pleasures: cooking a good meal, reading, or meeting a friend for a drink. It’s a quiet, purposeful life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
